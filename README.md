# Purpose
This is a Go library to manage structures of configuration loaded from JSON files.
The idea is to use config without fussing much over it, and to allow configuration to change
at run-time and be used in new contexts without affecting running contexts.
Another aim is to document configuration and make it easy to edit it with some insight,
not only free text editing of JSON files.
